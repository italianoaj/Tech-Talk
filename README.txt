	For my final project of the class I have implemented node, express, mongodb, views, html, css, and js in order to create an online chat room for Hiram College computer
science majors. I struggled at thie beginning of this project with a few things. At first, i wanted to implement the use of socket.io to make each client "listen" for updates
from the server to recieve messages in real time. While I was not able to accomplish this because of the actual cs server settings, i was able to control a simulation type 
work around for the time being. Another problem i ran into came with sending my requests from the client to the server i created. I honestly struggled with this for about 3 days.
I was only able to accomplish the sending of POST requests when Professor Oliphant had time to assist me. I was not sending the obj as a string, which was causing me to recieve
an error for an unexpected token. When I fixed this, along with my parser, I was then able to read the json object I was sending.
